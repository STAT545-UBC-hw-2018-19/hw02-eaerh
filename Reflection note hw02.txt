A short reflection upon Assignment 2 in STAT 545A:


The assignment was nice as an introduction to more of the built in functions in R, as well as training on how to use ggplot. 
Worked through local directories and pushing all the files to GitHub eventually. 

Nice to get more training and hands on using crucial plotting functions in R, which will probably be really helpful later on.
